                <h1>Who am I?</h1>
                <p>
                    On paper, I am an economist from the University of Copenhagen. In life, I am much more than that.
                    <br>
                    From the outside, my upbringing seemed pretty normal and suburban, but from the inside of my mind,
                    something was off. For a long time, I walked around like an empty shell, out of touch with myself,
                    simply trying to keep up with the demands and expectations of my surroundings, until one day, when I
                    was compelled to break free. I moved to New York with absolutely no plan in mind and lived there
                    on/off for four years.
                    <br><br>
                    New York had space for me to explore and grow. It was during my time in New York that my interest in
                    art and creativity blossomed. I met some wonderful, inspiring artists and took courses in art
                    history at a university
                    in the city. I was accepted into Sotheby’s and Christie’s art business programs, but unfortunately,
                    due to my mental state, I realized that I had to go back home to Denmark to get help. That was three
                    years ago, and now, I am here, happily working with clay. It has become my mission to share joy
                    through the use of form and color,
                    and bring it into people’s everyday lives. <br><br>
                    Clay is my medium of choice, but my work is more than the physical outcome itself. #byValentin is
                    all about using forms and colors to create a sense of delight and contentment – experiences beyond
                    the physical.
